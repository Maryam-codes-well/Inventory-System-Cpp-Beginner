# Inventory-System-Cpp-Beginner
A beginner-level Inventory Management System built in C++ using file handling, arrays, and menu-driven logic.
# Inventory Management System (C++)

This is a **beginner-level Inventory Management System** built using **C++ fundamentals**.

I created this project to practice:
- File handling
- Arrays
- Functions
- Loops
- Menu-driven programs

## Features
- Add new products
- View all items
- Search items by name
- Search items by ID
- Update item details
- Delete items
- Persistent storage using text files

## Technologies Used
- C++
- File Handling (`ifstream`, `ofstream`)
- Standard Library

## How It Works
- Data is stored in a text file (`Inventory data.txt`)
- The program loads data at runtime
- All updates are saved back to the file

## How to Run
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler
2. Make sure `Inventory data.txt` is in the same folder
3. Run the executable

## Notes
This project is built **without using structures or classes**, focusing only on **C++ fundamentals**.
